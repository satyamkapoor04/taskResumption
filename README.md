# task_resumption (partial)
A Java based application to resume tasks. The goal is to provide an intuitive, easy-to-use interface; based on elements that user is already familiar with. The envisaged UI is to assist the user in resuming his routine work, via suggested identified activities (including recent user actions and recently accessed places from past session) and recommendation of future activities based on the past preferences. The user can select activities that he/she needs to resume and a list is generated.
The generated list can be assessed and can be updated anytime by the user. The main objective for generating the list is to let users keep track of all pending activities as well as activities that he/she might want to start in future. A desktop assistant is designed to deal with all related background sub-tasks (estimation of log duration, pre-processing of user log records, maintaining user saved list, re-launching an activity), and provide the user interfaces for user-interactions. The user records all his interactions via the provided interfaces and options.
